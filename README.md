AirBnB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interface in a clone of AirBnB.

This team project is part of the (Alx) Holberton School Software Engineering program.
It represents the first step towards building a full web application.

This first step consists of:

a custom command-line interface for data management,
and the base classes for the storage of this data.
